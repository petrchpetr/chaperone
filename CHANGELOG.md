## 0.3.10 (2022-07-30)

By petrch@gmail.com - make it python 3.7+ compatible - replace asyncio.async with ensure_future, provide a loader for pyyaml . 

## 0.3.00 (2015-10-04)

This is a major release that adds a number of important features and refinements.   Most importantly, a new automated test harness that simulates various process mixes has been added to the release process to assure that Chaperone manages processes in a consistent and reliable way from release to release.

In addition, Chaperone now recognizes `NOTIFY_SOCKET` upon start-up, and will inform the host's `systemd` of the status of the container.   This adds to Chaperone's existing support for notify-type processes within the container.  This means that container designers can choose any of a number of methods of signalling process readiness inside the container while Chaperone will translate those actions into suitable `systemd` notifications for the host.

This version is completely backward-compatible with older Chaperone versions.

Enhancements:

- Chaperone will recognize the `NOTIFY_SOCKET` environment variable if passed upon start-up and provide full `systemd` compatible notifications to the host.
- The [detect_exit](http://garywiz.github.io/chaperone/ref/config-global.html#settings-detect-exit) global setting, which defaults to `true` tells Chaperone to attempt to determine when all processes have completed and automatically terminate the container.  This was the previous default behavior, but the new setting provides flexibility for containers which remain dormant until processes are started manually.
- There is now a `telchap shutdown` command which provides orderly container shutdown from scripts.
- Added the `sdnotify-exec` utility which is a multi-purpose wrapper which can be used to proxy `NOTIFY_SOCKET` communication to the host, or can be used to determine if a container is properly started even outside of `systemd` contexts.

Refinements:

- Exit detection is now smarter about `cron` and `inetd` jobs and will not cause container exit if either of those types have scheduled operations which have not yet been triggered.
- The [--disable-services](http://garywiz.github.io/chaperone/ref/command-line.html#option-disable-services) switch now truly disables services rather than not defining them.  Therefore, containers in such containers can now be started manually.
- Cron-type services now have more well-defined behavior for `telchap stop` which will unschedule the service, and `telchap reset` which will merely kill the current job and reschedule another.
- If Chaperone `notify`-type services signal with `ERRNO=n`, then Chaperone will intelligently pass this error number up to `systemd` if the error was the direct cause of container termination, otherwise it is noted in the logs and `systemd` won't find out about it.

## 0.2.40 (2015-09-08)

Enhancements:

- Both `uid` and `gid` can be specified using the path-format of the [--create-user](http://garywiz.github.io/chaperone/ref/command-line.html#option-create-user) command-line switch.

Refinements:

- The `${ENV:-foo}` expansion format now behaves like `bash` where 'foo' is the result if the variable `ENV` is undefined or null (blank).  Previously, it required that the variable be undefined.  This behavior is now consistent throughout all expansion operators.
- Improved the environment expansion code to handle outlying cases, as well as be signfiicantly more readable.  Used coverage analysis to improve unit test coverage for complex expansions involving recursion.

Bug fixes:

- Newer versions of Python's `asyncio` (present in some distros) could hang when starting an **inetd**-style socket process.

## 0.2.37 (2015-08-24)

Enhancements:

- Add support for **inetd**-compatible dynamic TCP socket connections.  See the description of the [port configuration parameter](http://garywiz.github.io/chaperone/ref/config-service.html#service-port) for a complete description of this feature.
- Added [_CHAP_SERVICE_SERIAL](http://garywiz.github.io/chaperone/ref/env.html#env-chap-service-serial) and [_CHAP_SERVICE_TIME](http://garywiz.github.io/chaperone/ref/env.html#env-chap-service-time) environment variables to provide useful information to 'cron' and 'inetd' services which may execute multiple times.
- Added the ability to add a `gid` number to the path-based format of the [--create-user](http://garywiz.github.io/chaperone/ref/command-line.html#option-create-user) command-line switch.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed `telchap stop` so that it no longer would cause service restarts to occur.
- Improved the service restart logic to handle a wider variety of service failure situations.

## 0.2.31 (2015-08-11)

Enhancements:

- Add support for --create-user name:/path so that user identity can be based upon
  the permissions set for a given path.  This helps workaround the file permissions
  issues under OSX/VirtualBox where you can't really modify the mounted file
  permissions and instead "get what you get".

## 0.2.30 (2015-08-07)

Enhancements:

- Add support for --archive/-a to envcp.

## 0.2.29 (2015-08-05)

Refinements:

- Allow backslash-escaping of VBAR construct contents in environment variable
  if-then-else construct.

## 0.2.28 (2015-08-03)

Refinements:

- Create a special-case syntax for shell escapes: ``$(`shell-command`)`` mainly to
  assure that such syntaxes are propery supported instead of being expanded as a
  side-effect.  Previously, the syntax above would treat the result of the command
  as the name of an environment variable, and since it was not found, would insert
  the results.   Since it was a useful trick, formalizing the use and eliminating
  edge cases was important.
- Disabled shell escapes by default in ``envcp`` and added the ``--shell-enable``
  switch to enable them.
- Added further documentation about shell escapes to clarify exactly how they
  work and how they should be used.

## 0.2.27 (2015-08-01)

Enhancements:

- Added documentation for ``envcp`` in the new utilities section of the documentation.
- Enhanced environment-variable expansions so they are smart about nesting.
- Fixed syslog receiver so that trailing newlines are stripped (programs like ``sudo``
  and ``openvpn`` terminate their log lines this way, even though it is a questionable
  practice).

## 0.2.26 (2015-07-28)

Enhancements:

- Added the ``:/`` regex substitution expansion option, which provides a more extensive and useful
  feature set than the bash-compatible options.
- Updated the documentation to reflect the new expansion option and added a footnote about
  bash compatibility.

## 0.2.25 (2015-07-27)

Enhancements:

 - Added the ``:?`` and ``:|`` environemnt variable expansion options.  The first works similarly
   to bash and raises an error if a variable is not defined.  The second adds more versatility to
   expansions by allowing the expansion to depend upon the particular value of a variable.
-  Added documntation for the above.

## 0.2.24 (2015-07-27)

Bug Fixes:

 - Made `setproctitle` an optional install so that `--no-install-recommends` can be used
   on `apt-get` installs to streamline image size ([#1, @mc0e](https://github.com/garywiz/chaperone/issues/1))

Other:

 - PyPi distribution is no longer done in "wheel" format, since that limits the ability
   to include optional dependencies.  Source format is used instead.
